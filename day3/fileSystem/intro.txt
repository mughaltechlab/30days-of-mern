As a proactive and self-driven graduate specializing in frontend web development, I bring a wealth of experience
in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. With a solid foundation in Software Engineering acquired
during my Bachelor's degree, I bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application. I am
actively seeking a challenging position within a reputable organization where I can further enhance my skills,
expand my knowledge, and contribute my expertise to meaningful projects.
